			<p class="border">The horse evolved over 45 to 55 million years from a small multi-toed creature into the large, single-toed animal of today. Humans first domesticated them between 4000 and 3000 BC. They are a remarkably fast and well balanced animal which helps them to escape predators in the wild.</p>
